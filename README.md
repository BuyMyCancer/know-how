The expertise performed during the development of Buy My Cancer project paved the way in the field of crowdfunding. It was an effort of many people who spend many days and nights looking for a solution to make it happen. Now the creators of Buy My Cancer would like to share their knowledge and experience with others. With the hope to further improve the effectiveness of other crowdfunding projects. 

Alivia Oncology Foundation provides free of charge a set of information that contributed to the success of this project. 
The repository consists of: 
1) a description of the project, a template of the regulations of the fundraising campaign, an application for an individual tax interpretation and a tax interpretation - by Bird & Bird 
2) presentation of the communication concept of the Buy My Cancer project. 
We hope that the provided materials will become an inspiration for other NGOs and everyone else who is in need to collect funds for life saving treatment.

Short description of Buy My Cancer project: 

NFTs have seen a huge surge in popularity. In 2022, nearly $41billion of crypto was spent on NFT marketplaces. However, most of these NFTs serve little purpose beyond proving the owner possesses something rare. Meanwhile, cancer remains one of the world’s biggest killers. Accounting for nearly 1 in 6 deaths worldwide. But while many cancers can now be cured, the cost of treatment can be astronomical. Especially when it comes to rare cancers. Could rare NFTs be used to fund treatment for rare cancers? 

Idea 

Buy My Cancer is an innovative funding model designed to help cover the costly treatment of rare cancers. Turning real patients’ living cancer cells into beautiful and powerful pieces of art, which are then auctioned. All funds raised go to life-saving treatment for these patients, and further research into rare cancer treatments.

Execution 

A real patient’s living cancer cells are photographed using a confocal microscope – creating high resolution three-dimensional images. These beautiful and powerful images are then transformed into pieces of art, minted into NFT collections, put up for auction, and advertised to collectors through social media and PR. Once this collection has been sold, and the proceeds have gone on to fund the patient’s life-saving cancer treatment, the process begins again with a new patient and a new artist. And so on and so on, continually saving lives with each new and unique NFT collection.
